// Make a keyless car EVEN BETTER!
// We are improving our car from previous exercise now.
// Solutions to future exercises will be in the .js file (meaning Javascript file) from now on.


//1. Make the above code have a function called checkDriverAge(). Whenever you call this function, you will get prompted for age. Use Function Declaration to create this function.
// Notice the benefit in having checkDriverAge() instead of copying and pasting the function everytime?

function checkDriverAge() {
    var age = prompt("What is your age?");

    if (Number(age) < 18) {
        alert("Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off");
    } else if (Number(age) > 18) {
        alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");
    } else if (Number(age) === 18) {
        alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");
    } else {
        alert("Sorry, age must be a number.");
    }
}

//2. Create another function that does the same thing, called checkDriverAge2() using Function Expression.

var checkDriverAge = function(age) {
    if (Number(age) < 18) {
        console.log("Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off");
    } else if (Number(age) > 18) {
        console.log("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");
    } else if (Number(age) === 18) {
        console.log("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");
    } else {
        console.log("Sorry, age must be a number.");
    }
}

//BONUS: Instead of using the prompt. Now, only use console.log and make the checkDriverAge() function accept an argument of age, so that if you enter:
// checkDriverAge(92);
// it returns "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!";
